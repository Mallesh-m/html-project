    <h1><U>HISTORY</U></h1>
    <p>
        <big>
            Paradise Restaurant, today celebrated as Hyderabad’s biryani landmark, has a rich history that dates back to 1953. It began as a small canteen inside the Paradise Cinema in Secunderabad, started by Hussain Hemati and Ghulam Hussain. In its early days, the place was known more for Irani chai, Osmania biscuits, and quick snacks rather than the biryani it would later become famous for. Over time, however, the modest café expanded into a 100-seat restaurant, slowly introducing Hyderabadi specialties that laid the foundation for its iconic reputation.In 1978, under the leadership of Ali Hemati, the restaurant entered a phase of transformation. It was renovated to meet the changing needs of diners, and in 1983 it introduced the concept of a family dining section and takeaway services—features that helped Paradise grow far beyond a neighborhood eatery. Even when the Paradise Cinema shut down in 1987, the restaurant continued to thrive, firmly establishing itself as a culinary destination in the city.By the mid-1990s, Paradise underwent large-scale modernization, updating its interiors and infrastructure to keep pace with contemporary restaurants. In 2006, it embraced technology by computerizing its operations, ensuring consistency and efficiency in service. These steps, combined with its commitment to authentic Hyderabadi biryani, elevated Paradise into a symbol of Hyderabad’s food culture, attracting not only locals but also tourists and dignitaries from around the world.Its recognition grew further in 2017 when Paradise entered the Limca Book of Records for serving over 70 lakh plates of biryani in a single year, while also winning awards for being one of the best biryani-serving restaurants in Asia. This success encouraged larger ambitions, and in 2014, private equity firm Samara Capital invested in the brand, bringing in professional management and driving its expansion. With Gautam Gupta as CEO, Paradise began to spread across India, opening outlets in cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, Gurugram, Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam, with plans to reach more than a hundred outlets and even venture into global markets.From a small tea and snack stall to a nationwide restaurant chain, Paradise has remained deeply tied to the heritage of Hyderabad. Its biryani is no longer just a dish but an experience, representing the city’s flavors, culture, and pride, while proving how a humble canteen could evolve into a legendary brand that continues to shape India’s dining history.

    <h1><U>COOKING</U></h1>
    <p>
        <big>
            Paradise Restaurant is celebrated across India for preserving the authentic taste of Hyderabadi cuisine and presenting it with a consistent, royal touch. The foundation of their cooking lies in centuries-old traditions from the Nizami kitchens, where Mughlai grandeur meets the earthy flavors of the Deccan. Every dish begins with meticulous preparation, starting from the careful selection of basmati rice, fresh vegetables, prime cuts of meat, and whole spices sourced for their quality and aroma. Chefs at Paradise emphasize slow cooking, allowing ingredients to release their natural flavors gradually, which creates the deep, layered taste for which the restaurant is famous. Their signature Hyderabadi dum biryani is an art form in itself, with marinated meat resting overnight in yogurt, ginger, garlic, and freshly ground spices before being combined with half-cooked rice. This mixture is sealed in a heavy-bottomed vessel, traditionally with dough, and cooked on a gentle flame so steam infuses every grain, resulting in biryani that is fragrant, moist, and perfectly balanced. Alongside biryani, Paradise is known for a variety of kebabs such as seekh kebab, shami kebab, and tandoori delicacies, where meats are marinated in spiced yogurt, skewered, and roasted over charcoal to achieve a smoky yet tender finish. The restaurant’s curries and gravies showcase a similar dedication to slow simmering, with onions browned patiently, spices roasted and ground in-house, and gravies enriched with cashews, almonds, coconut, or cream to create a silky texture. Rich ghee, saffron strands, fresh mint, and coriander are common finishing touches that heighten aroma and taste. Vegetarian offerings receive equal attention, featuring lentils, seasonal vegetables, and paneer cooked with the same precise layering of spices as the meat dishes. The use of regional ingredients like tamarind, dried red chilies, and curry leaves adds subtle South Indian accents, blending beautifully with the Mughlai base. Paradise chefs maintain perfect spice balance, ensuring dishes are flavorful without being overwhelmingly hot, appealing to both traditional diners and newcomers. Their bread selection, including roomali roti, naan, and kulcha, is cooked in clay tandoors that give a distinct charred edge and soft interior. Even accompaniments like raita and chutneys are freshly prepared to complement the richness of the main dishes. Over decades, Paradise has refined this cooking style into a dependable standard, ensuring that every outlet—from the original Secunderabad location to newer branches—serves food that tastes consistently regal. The kitchen philosophy celebrates patience, precision, and respect for heritage, where each recipe is treated like a craft passed down through generations. Whether you order a simple plate of biryani or a full spread of kebabs, curries, and breads, you experience the same harmony of spices, aroma of slow cooking, and comfort of authentic Hyderabadi hospitality. This blend of royal techniques, regional spices, and careful execution defines Paradise Restaurant’s timeless and world-famous culinary style.

    <h1><u>STYLE OF BIRYANI</u></h1>
    <P>
        <big>
            Paradise’s biryani is the very definition of classic Hyderabadi dum cooking, a tradition they have refined and protected for decades. The foundation begins with the finest long-grain basmati rice, carefully washed, soaked, and parboiled so that each grain remains separate yet firm. The meat—whether succulent mutton, tender chicken, or on occasion seafood—is marinated for hours, often overnight, in a velvety mixture of thick yogurt, fresh ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, and a proprietary blend of freshly roasted and ground spices. This patient marination allows the spices to penetrate deeply, ensuring that every bite of meat carries layers of complex flavor.When it is time to cook, the chefs arrange alternating layers of marinated meat and half-cooked rice in a broad, heavy-bottomed handi. Between each layer they scatter golden fried onions, fresh mint, and bright coriander leaves, then drizzle saffron-infused milk and a touch of warm ghee to enrich the aroma and color. The handi is sealed with a strip of dough to create an airtight chamber, a hallmark of the dum technique. Gentle, even heat is applied from below—traditionally with charcoal—so that the steam inside cooks the dish slowly and evenly. As the meat releases its own juices, the rice absorbs the essence of the marinade, spices, and saffron, resulting in grains that are fluffy, fragrant, and delicately spiced, while the meat becomes meltingly tender.Paradise maintains a precise balance of flavors rather than overwhelming heat, letting the natural perfume of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaf shine through. The finished biryani is served with cooling cucumber raita and the tangy, slightly spicy mirchi ka salan, creating a meal that is rich yet perfectly balanced. Every step—from selecting rice to controlling the flame—is carried out with remarkable discipline, allowing the taste to remain consistent across all their kitchens.
